#Rossmann Pharmaceuticals: Finance Analyst Predictions
Welcome to the Rossmann Pharmaceuticals repository! This repository contains valuable predictions and analyses specifically designed for finance analysts. The tasks in this project are divided into two groups: Task 1 and Task 2, each focusing on different aspects.

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning
Task 1 is dedicated to performing essential exploratory data analysis (EDA) and thorough data cleaning. By carefully examining the provided datasets and applying effective cleaning techniques, I tried to  ensure the reliability and accuracy of the subsequent analyses.Task 2: Deep Learning Model Analysis
In Task 2, I will assist you in utilizing advanced deep learning models to conduct comprehensive analyses. Together, we will leverage the power of deep learning to extract valuable insights and make predictions that are crucial for financial decision-making. By employing cutting-edge techniques, we aim to provide accurate and reliable predictions for your finance analysis tasks.

Accessing the Datasets
All the datasets required for this project are conveniently located in the "data" folder. Feel free to explore and utilize them to perform your analyses and predictions effectively.

Data Version Control with DVC
To ensure efficient management and control of data versions, I have implemented DVC (Data Version Control). With DVC, you can easily track, organize, and switch between different versions of the datasets. This feature enables seamless collaboration and reproducibility of results.

Setting up Your Environment
To make the best use of this project, please set up your environment accordingly. Ensure that all the necessary dependencies and libraries are correctly installed. By doing so, you can fully leverage the functionalities provided in this repository and conduct your analyses efficiently.

I hope that this project proves to be a valuable resource for your finance analysis tasks. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
